# Contributing to EVE

Thank you for your interest in EVE.

This repository is an **architecture and platform overview**.
The core implementation of EVE is intentionally private.

Contributions are welcome — within clearly defined boundaries.

## What You *Can* Contribute

You are welcome to contribute to:

### 📘 Documentation
- Improving clarity in README and platform descriptions
- Adding examples, diagrams or conceptual explanations
- Proposing better terminology or structure

### 🧠 Architecture & Design Feedback
- Suggestions on platform structure
- Discussions about AI governance, determinism and safety
- Use-case proposals for new categories or domains

### 🧪 Example Applications (Conceptual)
- Pseudocode examples (no core logic)
- Demonstration workflows
- “How EVE could be used for X” writeups

### 🧭 Roadmap Input
- Feature requests (high-level)
- Platform direction feedback
- Integration ideas

## What Is *Out of Scope*

The following are intentionally **not accepted** in this repository:

- Requests to open-source the EVE core
- Reverse-engineering attempts
- PRs that attempt to replicate internal core logic
- Contributions that bypass safety or control layers
- Feature demands that conflict with EVE’s design principles

EVE prioritizes **correctness, traceability and human accountability** over speed or convenience.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue first**
   - Describe your idea, suggestion or question
   - Explain *why* it matters

2. **Discuss before implementing**
   - Most contributions are design- or documentation-driven
   - This avoids wasted work

3. **Submit Pull Requests**
   - Keep changes focused and minimal
   - Reference the related issue
   - Follow existing style and structure

---

## Guiding Principles

All contributions should align with EVE’s core philosophy:

- Deterministic behavior
- Explicit execution boundaries
- Observable and debuggable systems
- Separation of analysis and action
- Human-in-the-loop control

If a proposal violates these principles, it will not be merged.

## Licensing

By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions
may be used under the same license as this project.

## Final Note

EVE is not trying to be everything.
It is trying to be **correct**.

If that resonates with you — welcome.
